          <h3 class="subTitle">Training Program</h3>
          <div class="text-info">
            <p>This tutorial project was developed as part of the free online course "Javascript/Front-end Mentoring
              Program (in English)" from The
              Rolling Scopes
              community.
            </p>
            <p> The training consists of 3 stages. There are strict requirements for the transition to each higher
              stage. This particular course of study takes place in the form of self-study. This means that students
              have access to pre-assessment of webinars and two-week live Q&A sessions with course trainers. Organizers
              provide students with a list of topics that must be covered for each stage with
              recommended deadlines.
            </p>
            <p>After accomplishing all three stages of education, students will receive an electronic certificate of
              completion.</p>
